       "\"Penn Matrix Test (PMAT): Total Skipped Items (items not presented because maximum errors allowed reached [5 in a row]). The PMAT measures fluid intelligence via non-verbal reasoning using an abbreviated version of the Raven's Progressive Matrices Form A developed by Gur and colleagues (Bilker et al. 2012).  Participants are presented with patterns made up of 2x2, 3x3 or 1x5 arrangements of squares, with one of the squares missing.  The participant must pick one of five response choices that best fits the missing square on the pattern.  The task has 24 items and 3 bonus items, arranged in order of increasing difficulty.  However, the task discontinues if the participant makes 5 incorrect responses in a row.\""

This is because the test is stopped after 5 errors, meaning that correct responses and skipped items directly depend on each other. They are thus collinear, which can cause problems in the factor estimation. Consequently, we will only use correct responses and reaction time for the PMAT."

The correlation is less strong between the total correct answers and the number of positions off than in the PMAT, but the two measures are dependent nonetheless. The VSPLOT is a visual task where the participant has to match the orientation of a line shown on the screen. The number of positions off is thus a more fine-grained measurement and what we will add as the accuracy score for the VSPLOT."
